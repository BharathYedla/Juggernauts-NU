Hackathon Project: Player Performance Prediction

Overview

Welcome to the Player Performance Prediction project! This hackathon project aims to predict football player performance based on key metrics, helping coaches, analysts, and teams identify top performers and underperformers efficiently. The model leverages data from multiple football matches, focusing on performance factors such as shots, assists, xG (expected goals), and more.

The project uses machine learning techniques to predict player performance, providing valuable insights to make data-driven decisions in player selection and strategy.

Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

Predict player performance based on key factors like shots, xG, goals, assists, and more.
Identify top performers and underperformers.
Use these insights to help teams and coaches enhance their strategy.
The model predicts player performance using historical match data to improve the understanding of factors that affect on-field performance.

Dataset

The project uses data collected from various matches and includes several key metrics for each player. Below are the important columns from the dataset:

player_name: Name of the player
home_team: The team the player played for at home
away_team: The team the player played against
year: Year of the match
Position: Position of the player on the field
Minutes played: Total minutes played in the match
goals: Number of goals scored
assists: Number of assists made
shots: Total shots taken
xg: Expected goals
successful_actions: Actions that were successful
total_passes: Total passes attempted
dribbles: Number of successful dribbles
total_duels: Total duels contested
recoveries: Ball recoveries
yellow_cards: Number of yellow cards received
red_cards: Number of red cards received
This dataset is then processed to extract important features like xG per 90 minutes, Goals per 90 minutes, and xG Difference (difference between goals scored and expected goals).

Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, relevant columns are selected, and additional metrics like xG_per_90 and Goals_per_90 are calculated.
Model Training: A machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) is used to predict player performance based on the selected metrics.
Model Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using metrics like R2 Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.
Visualization: Data visualizations are generated to explore player performance and compare metrics.
Key Features

1. Player Performance Metrics
We calculate key metrics such as:

xG_per_90: The expected goals per 90 minutes played.
Goals_per_90: The actual goals scored per 90 minutes played.
xG_diff: The difference between actual goals and expected goals (indicating how well a player is finishing chances).
2. Prediction Model
The model predicts overall player performance based on metrics such as:

Shots on target
Successful actions
Goals scored
Assists made
Total duels and recoveries
This helps in identifying players who are underperforming based on their expected contribution.

Requirements

To run the project, make sure to install the following Python libraries:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/player-performance-prediction.git
cd player-performance-prediction
Prepare the data:
Place the dataset (e.g., player_data.csv) in the project folder.
Load and preprocess the data using the provided Python script (data_preprocessing.py).
Train the model:
Run the train_model.py to train the model using the preprocessed data.
Example command:
python train_model.py
Evaluate and visualize:
Run evaluate_model.py to check model performance and visualize the predictions.
Model Evaluation

The model is evaluated based on the following metrics:

R2 Score: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions.
Feature Importance: Identifies which features are most important in predicting player performance.
Example Use Case

Scenario: Predicting player performance in a match.

A coach wants to identify top performers before selecting a squad.
Using this model, the coach can input historical match data to predict the expected contribution of each player, helping make more informed decisions.
Insights and Recommendations

Top Performers: The players with the highest xG per 90 and Goals per 90 can be considered as key contributors for the team.
Underperformers: Players with a large negative xG_diff (goals scored less than expected) might need to improve their finishing or decision-making.
Position-Specific Insights: Certain positions like forwards tend to have higher xG per 90 compared to defenders or goalkeepers.
Conclusion

This hackathon project provides an innovative way to predict player performance based on key match metrics, offering valuable insights for coaches, analysts, and teams. By using this model, teams can optimize player selection and improve on-field strategies.

Future Improvements

Additional Data: Incorporate more features like player fitness, team dynamics, or opposition strength to improve prediction accuracy.
Advanced Models: Try deep learning models for more complex predictions, such as neural networks.
Real-time Predictions: Integrate with real-time match data for instant performance prediction.
